        The Dog was delighted with the invitation, and as he stood by and saw the preparations for the feast, said to himself: Capital fare indeed! this is, in truth, good luck. I shall revel in dainties, and I will take good care to lay in an ample stock to-night, for I may have nothing to eat to-morrow.

        As he said this to himself, he wagged his tail, and gave a sly look at his friend who had incited him.

        But his tail wagging to and fro caught the cook's eye, who, seeing a stranger, straightway seized him by the legs, and threw him out the window to the street below.

        When he reached the ground, he set off yelping down the street; upon which the neighbors' dogs ran up to him and asked him how he liked his supper. In faith,said he, with a sorry smile, I hardly know, for we drank so deeply, that I can't even tell you which way I got out."/>
